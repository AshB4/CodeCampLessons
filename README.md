# CodeCampLessons
My adventures at FreeCodeCamp.org I started the lesssons on July 12,2022.

    Simply goofing around. I started to learn html and css through freecodecamp.org as well as other free resources.
This is the 1st thing I made with my new skills. 
It is your standard bolier plate for html to start a new site and a little bit of css.
